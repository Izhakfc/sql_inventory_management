# sql_inventory_management
Inventory Management with SQL
# Overview
In this project we created a DATABASE in AWS that is connected to an appery mobile application that allows the user to input the data of the received uniform merchandise and update the information of the user inventory in real time when a client redeems a uniform voucher.
In this analysis we plan to include a bar scanner into the application, and propose a refernce code for the stores "Ofertas de Guamuchil" and "Un1tex" that references quantitative variables such as the redeemed garments, the school name or the size. That help the user to have a control of its inventory and discover sales patterns and give them a better idea of where to invest in their merchandise.
# Objectives
- [x] Generate a Free Database in AWS (RDS)
- [x] Create a connection with postgreSQL.
- [x] Generate the schema of the input inventory table
- [ ] Create the app layout with appery.io.
- [ ] Explore and define the relevant variables of each redeemed garment.
- [ ] Propose a "reference code" that allows the user have a reference of the garment characteristics.
- [ ] Create a process that reads the proposed "reference code" and store the info of the product into the input inventory table.
- [ ] Develop a process that creates/updates the table and allows the user to display garment availability in real time.
- [ ] Analyze the collected data from the uniform voucer redemption season from the stores "Ofertas de Guamuchil" and "Un1tex" and share insights with the users
